\section{Introduction}

The goal of this paper is to plan the improvement of the existing Flora Danica application, a learning application built on the Kivy framework. The paper will look into previous research and work on learning applications and gamification, and will use concepts from these areas to improve the existing application.

The first chapter provides an introduction to the paper as well as the topics of learning applications and gamification. The second chapter explores and discusses previous work on related topics, as well as on user study procedures. The third chapter proposes a solution in possible extensions to the application. It also describes the planned process for conducting the user studies. The final chapter contains final discussion as well as a summary of the paper.
