\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes previous work that has been done in related fields. The relevant topics such as learning applications, collaboration, multi-touch platforms and gamification are often intertwined, and as such the studies typically cover several or all of these topics.

\section{Related Work}

Ardito et al.\citep{Ardito} found that learning applications are a good supplement to traditional learning, and can help in the final phase of learning, where learners rely on iconic knowledge representation such as images to solidify things learned previously. In their study, students received a lecture on Roman history, then went on a field trip to an old area where they more closely experienced what they had learned during the lecture. The following week they used a learning application where they had to use the knowledge they had gained to create factual sentences about the subject. A multiple-choice test given to the students before and after use of the application showed that students had more correct answers after using the application.

Antle et al.\citep{AntleFutura} chose to focus their application not on teaching users about specific concepts, but rather to give users a better understanding of familiar concepts and facilitate behavioral change through a shift in awareness.


%\section{Multi-User Applications}
%This section describes findings regarding research on multi-user applications, i.e. what is important to focus on for applications specifically developed as multi-user apps.

%\section{Gamification}
%This section describes findings regarding research on gamification, such as benefits and important concepts. E.g. different kinds of motivation.
